Computer graphics are pictures and movies created using computers - usually referring to image data created by a computer specifically with help from specialized graphic hardware and software. It is a subset of computer science and a recent field. The phrase was coined by computer graphics researcher William Fetter of Boeing in 1960. Another name for the field is computer-generated imagery, or simply CGI.

Important topics in computer graphics include sprite graphics, vector graphics, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, and computer vision, among others. The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of geometry, optics, and physics. Computer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and beautifully to the user, and processing image data received from the physical world. The interaction and understanding of computers and interpretation of data has been made easier because of computer graphics. Computer graphic development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized animation, movies, advertising, video games, and graphic design generally
